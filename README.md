# GIS and Geospatial Automation Projects

This repository contains a collection of GIS and geospatial automation projects developed during my IT 338 course, focused on geospatial programming and Python scripting. Each project highlights my ability to automate and streamline GIS tasks, using tools like ArcGIS Pro and Python.

## Projects

---

### **Automated GIS Pipeline Processing Tool (IT 338 Final Project)**

- **Description**:  
  Developed a Python-based ArcGIS Pro tool to process pipeline data from text files, automating feature class creation and the generation of 25-foot buffers for city planning. The tool helps to exclude pipeline areas from future development planning by creating and merging buffer zones around pipelines.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated feature class creation based on pipeline data
  - Generation of 25-foot buffers for spatial planning
  - Implemented validation, logging, and error handling for reliable execution
- **Technologies**: Python, ArcPy, GIS Automation, Geospatial Data Processing

### **Geospatial Map Series Automation (Scripting Project Seven – IT 338)**

- **Description**:  
  Created an ArcGIS Pro project for generating county maps of Virginia, automating the export process to PDFs using Python scripting and dynamic text within a map series. This project showcases how Python scripting can be used to generate map series for large areas, saving time and increasing efficiency.
- **Key Features**:
  - Automated creation of county maps
  - Dynamic text for map series to customize exports
  - Scripting for batch PDF export of maps
- **Technologies**: Python, ArcGIS Pro, Map Series Automation

### **Custom ArcGIS Pro Geoprocessing Tool (Scripting Project Five – IT 338)**

- **Description**:  
  Designed and integrated a custom geoprocessing tool in ArcGIS Pro to generate wilderness areas by buffering and erasing features like roads, trails, and campsites within a park boundary. The tool provides a streamlined interface for users to perform complex geospatial operations in a few clicks.
- **Key Features**:
  - Creation of wilderness areas by buffering and erasing features
  - Seamless integration into ArcGIS Pro’s user interface
  - Parameter validation, logging, and error handling for a smooth user experience
- **Technologies**: Python, ArcGIS Pro, ArcPy, Geospatial Automation

## IT 338 Scripting Projects

This repository also includes all of my scripting projects completed during the IT 338 course. These projects demonstrate my skills in geospatial programming, automation, and GIS data processing. I have provided each project as a reference, showing a wide range of geospatial scripting techniques, from geoprocessing tools to map series automation.
