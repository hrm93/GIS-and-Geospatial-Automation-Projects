Title: Export Virginia County Maps to PDF
Course: IT 338 - Geospatial Programming
Author: Hannah Rose Morgenstein
Date: 2025-03-02
Project: Scripting Project Seven

Description:
This script automates the process of exporting county maps from an ArcGIS Pro
project (.aprx) using the map series feature. It loops through all counties 
in Virginia and exports a separate PDF for each one.

How It Works:
1. The script opens an ArcGIS Pro project (.aprx) and retrieves the layout 
   named "Virginia Counties."
2. It ensures that the layout has a Map Series enabled.
3. The script loops through each page of the Map Series, setting the 
   current page to the county being processed.
4. It retrieves the county name from the field 'NAMELSAD00' and uses it 
   to name the exported PDF.
5. If the file already exists, the script skips exporting to avoid redundancy.
6. The script logs each step, including successful exports, skipped files, 
   and any errors encountered.
7. Execution time is recorded at the end to track performance.

Key Features and Enhancements:
- **Error Handling:** Ensures that missing APRX files, layouts, or required 
  fields do not crash the script.
- **Logging System:** Tracks script execution and errors in a log file for 
  easy debugging.
- **Efficiency:** Skips counties that have already been exported to save time.
- **Performance Tracking:** Measures execution time to optimize workflow.

Requirements:
- An ArcGIS Pro project (.aprx) with a layout containing an enabled map series.
- The layout must reference a feature class of county boundaries as the index layer.
- The project should include roads, streams, and towns layers.

This script is designed for automation and ensures that all county maps 
are exported efficiently with minimal manual intervention.
